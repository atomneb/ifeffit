The files in this directory will build the ifeffit dll for Windows using MinGW
that can be easily called from C.

1. open a regular Windows command shell. Move to this directory.

2. set up to use MinGW.  With MinGW installed in C:\MinGW, execute
    use_mingw.bat

   (you may want to look at / edit the very simple use_mingw.bat)

3. build libifeffit.a for MinGW:
      cp sys.h ..\lib\sys.h
      cp lib_Makefile ..\lib\Makefile
      cd ..\lib
      make

   note that a ./configure ; make will from the top level will fail (but
   mostly work in compiling the code!)

4. Move back to this directory and run make:
     cd ..\win32
     make

Voila, an ifeffit_12.dll that works!! Try Iff_Python.py for a test of
loading and using this dll!

 
Note: This is currently using PGPLOT as supplied by GrWin.  There is no png
or gif driver supported here.  I will work on this....
