I altered the standard distribution of readline 5.0 in the following ways:

  == removed examples, documentation
  == modified configure.in to not build Makefile for doc, examples
  == modified Makefile.in to build only the static library 
     and to not install anything

GNU Readline 5.0 is distributed under the GPL.  

The full kit of readline 5.0 is available from the FSF/GNU.
